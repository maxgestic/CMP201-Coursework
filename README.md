#### Planning

**Ideas:**
- DFS vs BFS Algorithm
    - Find path of a chess piece on a board
    - Need to create script for the chess board
    - All possible moves would be children in the tree
    - Use algorithm to find shortest path
    - Applying that algorithm to find best move from the starting square to the finishing one
    - User would define starting location and finish location
